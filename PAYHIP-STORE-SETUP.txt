STORE TAGLINE (short)

Pattern support for the ones who feel too much and see too clearly.


====================================================
STORE DESCRIPTION (for About section)
====================================================

I'm Scar Kade. I turn scars into mirrors.

I help you understand the patterns behind your pain so you can finally see what's really happening and decide what to do next.

I'm not a therapist. I'm a survivor, pattern reader, and educator. I've been the scapegoat, the golden child, and the black sheep. Pattern tracking kept me alive. Now I teach it.

Here you'll find:
• Workbooks and toolkits for self-paced healing
• Programs with video lessons and 1:1 support
• Scripts for hard conversations
• Nervous system regulation tools

Your patterns are not your fault. Learning them is your power.
