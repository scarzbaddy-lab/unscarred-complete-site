SHORT DESCRIPTION (for product card):
Emergency grounding techniques and body-based resets for when you're in it.

You're dysregulated. Your thoughts are spiraling. Your body feels like it's not yours.

This is your emergency kit.

What's inside:
• 5 grounding techniques that actually work mid-crisis
• Breathing protocols for different states (panic, freeze, rage)
• Body-based resets you can do anywhere
• The "Right Now" checklist for when you can't think straight
• Scripts for what to say to yourself when you're in it

----- PATTERN TRACKING GUIDE -----
Name: Pattern Tracking Guide
Price: $0 (Free)
Category: Free Resources
URL Slug: pattern-tracking-guide
Thumbnail: thumb-pattern-tracking-guide.svg

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
Learn to document reality when your mind is foggy or your story gets twisted.

FULL DESCRIPTION:
When you're in survival mode, your memory gets unreliable. When you're being gaslit, you start doubting what actually happened.

Pattern tracking fixes that.

This guide teaches you:
• How to track patterns without obsessing
• The simple log format that makes patterns visible
• What to track (and what to ignore)
• How to use your data when you need evidence
• Why writing it down changes everything

This isn't about proving yourself to anyone. It's about seeing clearly so you can make better decisions.

For survivors, high-functioning anxious attachers, and anyone who's been told they're "too sensitive" or "making things up."

2. PROGRAMS
====================================================

----- ANXIOUS HEALING PROGRAM -----
Name: Anxious Healing Program
Price: $147
Category: Programs
URL Slug: anxious-healing
Thumbnail: thumb-anxious-healing.svg

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
4-week curriculum to calm your body, clean up your asks, and build steady connection.

FULL DESCRIPTION:
You text too much. You need reassurance. You spiral when they don't respond. You know you're being "too much" but you can't stop.

This program changes that.

What you get:
• 4 weeks of video lessons + written guides
• Daily micro-drills you can do in 5 minutes
• Scripts for clean asks (without the desperation)
• Regulation techniques that work in real situations
• 2 included 1:1 calls with Scar (30 min each)

Week 1: Understand your anxious system
Week 2: Body regulation basics
Week 3: Clean communication scripts
Week 4: Building steady connection

This isn't about suppressing your needs. It's about expressing them in ways that actually get met.

For chasers, over-texters, and anyone who spirals when they don't hear back.

Your patterns are not your fault. Learning them is your power.

----- AVOIDANT HEALING PROGRAM -----
Name: Avoidant Healing Program
Price: $197
Category: Programs
URL Slug: avoidant-healing
Thumbnail: thumb-avoidant-healing.svg

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
For those who shut down, need space, and feel suffocated by closeness.

FULL DESCRIPTION:
You pull away. You need space—lots of it. When people get close, you feel suffocated. You've been called "cold" or "emotionally unavailable."

But you're not broken. Your nervous system learned that closeness is dangerous.

What's inside:
• Video lessons on the avoidant pattern (and what's underneath it)
• Journaling prompts that actually go somewhere
• Practical scripts for staying present without losing yourself
• Exercises for increasing capacity for intimacy gradually
• How to communicate your needs without shutting down

This program helps you understand why you pull away—and gives you tools to stay present when you want to.

For the ones who run. The ones who need exits. The ones who feel relief when relationships end.

This isn't about forcing yourself to be something you're not. It's about expanding what feels safe.

---

----- FEARFUL-AVOIDANT TRACK -----
Name: Fearful-Avoidant Track
Price: $247
Category: Programs
URL Slug: fearful-avoidant
Thumbnail: thumb-fearful-avoidant.svg

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
For the push-pull. When you want closeness and distance at the same time.

FULL DESCRIPTION:
You want them close. Then you need space. You crave connection but it feels dangerous. You're hot then cold. You confuse yourself.

The fearful-avoidant pattern is the most complex attachment style. You didn't get it from nowhere.

What's inside:
• Complete video curriculum on FA patterns
• Both anxious AND avoidant exercises (because you need both)
• Scripts for navigating the push-pull without destroying relationships
• Nervous system exercises for the constant swing
• How to build a relationship with someone who's confused by you
• FA Micro-Drills for daily regulation

This is the most comprehensive FA program available. If you've tried "anxious" content and "avoidant" content and neither fit—this is for you.

For the ones who are both. The hot-cold. The "I want you close but not that close."

Category: Programs
URL Slug: break-trauma-bond
Thumbnail: thumb-break-trauma-bond.svg

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
5-day program to understand why you can't leave and build the safety to get free.

FULL DESCRIPTION:
You know it's bad. Everyone tells you to leave. But you can't.

That's not weakness. That's a trauma bond.

5-Day Program:
Day 1: What a trauma bond actually is (and why it feels like love)
Day 2: The addiction cycle keeping you stuck
Day 3: Identity erosion and how to rebuild
Day 4: Creating safety before you can leave
Day 5: Exit strategies that actually work

This program is no-shame, no-pressure. I don't care if you leave or stay. I care that you see clearly.

If you're ready to understand why you can't leave—even when you want to—this is the program.

For the ones still in it. For the ones who just got out. For the ones who went back.

• How you each adapted differently
• Why your memories don't match
• What roles you were assigned (and how they still play out)
