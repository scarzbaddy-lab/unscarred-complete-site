EMAIL 2: DAY 1 - How to Use This
====================================================
Subject: How to get the most from your workbook
Send: 24 hours after purchase

---

Hi [First Name],

You downloaded [Product Name] yesterday. Here's how to make it actually work:

**THE MISTAKE MOST PEOPLE MAKE:**
They read it like a book. Skim the exercises. Tell themselves they'll "come back to it."

They don't.

**WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:**
- Set 15 minutes each day (same time works best)
- Do ONE exercise completely before moving on
- Write by hand when possible - it activates different brain pathways
- Don't judge what comes up. Just write.

**THIS WEEK'S GOAL:**
Complete [specific section/module name] by [day].

You don't have to be perfect. You just have to start.

If you get stuck on anything, hit reply. I read every email.

EMAIL 3: DAY 3 - Common Sticking Points
====================================================
Subject: Getting stuck? Read this.
Send: 72 hours after purchase

---

Hi [First Name],

By now you're either:

A) Making progress (great - keep going)
B) Haven't started yet (no judgment - let's fix that)
C) Started but got stuck somewhere (most common)

**IF YOU HAVEN'T STARTED:**
Open the workbook right now. Do the first exercise. It takes 5 minutes. 
That's it. Momentum beats motivation.

**IF YOU'RE STUCK:**
The most common place people freeze:

"[Specific exercise name]" - This one asks you to [what it asks].

Here's the thing: you don't need the perfect answer. Write something. 
Anything. You can always revise later. The goal is to get your thoughts 
out of your head and onto paper where you can actually work with them.

**IF YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS:**
Beautiful. Keep going. You're doing the work most people avoid.

Reply and tell me where you are. I love hearing progress stories.

Hi [First Name],

It's been one week since you got [Product Name].

Quick check-in: How's it going?

**BY NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE:**
- Completed [X section/module]
- Noticed some patterns you didn't see before
- Had some uncomfortable realizations (that's growth)
- Wanted to talk through what's coming up

**IF YOU WANT SUPPORT:**
I offer 1:1 calls specifically for working through what comes up in the workbooks.

→ Book a 30-minute call: [Calendar Link]
   $27 - we'll tackle one specific thing you're working through

→ Or grab a full hour: [Calendar Link]  
   $47 - deeper dive into your patterns

**Use code WORKBOOK15 for 15% off your first call.**

No pressure. The workbook works on its own. But sometimes talking it 
through with someone who gets it makes the difference.

Keep going. You're doing important work.

EMAIL 5: DAY 14 - Progress Check + Next Steps
====================================================
Subject: Two weeks in - what's changed?
Send: 14 days after purchase

---

Hi [First Name],

Two weeks ago you started [Product Name].

Take a moment right now and notice:

**WHAT'S DIFFERENT?**
- How do you talk to yourself now vs. before?
- What patterns have you caught yourself in?
- What feels even slightly clearer?

Sometimes healing is dramatic. Usually it's subtle. Small shifts. 
Moments where you pause instead of react. Times you recognize the 
pattern before you're in the middle of it.

That's real change. And it counts.

**WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU?**

If you found [Product Name] helpful, here's what usually helps next:

[Option 1: Related Product]
→ [Product Name] - [one-line description] - $XX
   [Link]

[Option 2: Program Upsell]
→ [Program Name] - [one-line description] - $XXX
   [Link]

[Option 3: Ongoing Support]
→ Text Support - daily pattern interrupts - $127/month
   [Link]

Or just keep working through what you have. Depth beats breadth.

Proud of you for doing this work.
